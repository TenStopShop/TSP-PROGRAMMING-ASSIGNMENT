            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>TechPro Academy was born from a simple idea: to make quality education accessible to everyone, no matter where they come from. The journey began in the vibrant community of Soweto, where a young dreamer named Thabo envisioned a platform that would empower individuals through technology and learning.</p>
            <p>With limited resources but an abundance of passion, Katlego started hosting small workshops in his neighborhood, sharing his knowledge of programming and digital skills. The positive feedback and eager participation inspired him to expand his vision, leading to the establishment of TechPro Academy.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to provide affordable, high-quality education that equips learners with the skills they need to succeed in the tech industry. We strive to foster an inclusive learning environment that celebrates diversity and empowers every individual to reach their full potential.</p>

            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>We envision a world where everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow, regardless of their background. By bridging the gap between education and accessibility, we aim to create a community of skilled professionals ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
